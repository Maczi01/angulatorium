# Let's Start
<br/>

Hello, I am Mattie.  
<br/>


I need to learn Angular, and this is the reason why I am starting this blog. I want to document my learning journey. I found a job where the company uses Angular. Although I have almost 3 years of experience with React, I need to learn Angular. I hope this blog will help me. My knowledge about Angular is currently limited. 

<br/>

Here is what I know about Angular so far:
 
 
 
<br/>

<ul>
<li> * It is a framework created by Google.</li>
<li> * TypeScript is the main language used.</li>
<li> * RxJS is used for reactive programming; I know it is complicated.</li>
<li> * Angular CLI is useful.</li>
<li> * `@Input` is similar to props in React.</li>
<li> * Classes and dependency injection are important.</li>
<li> * The community support is relatively poor.</li>
</ul>

<br/>
I've written some Angular code, but mainly from tutorials.


<br/>

How I Plan to Learn Angular:

<br/>

<ul>
<ol>1. I will read the documentation.</ol>
<ol>2. I will watch tutorials.</ol>
<ol>3. Projects, projects, projects.</ol>
<ol>4. I will use the SoloLearn app (there is one for Angular).</ol>
<ol>5. I will write blog posts.</ol>
<ol>6. I will watch conferences.</ol>
<ol>7. I think this is enough for the first post. </ol>
</ul>

<br/>

Probably my code will be very 'react-like' - I know I can use tailwind (<3) or angular-query, but I start with angular recommended solutions.
How to understand why I cannot use jsx, why classes again or why everything is ready
in to use, without installing additional libraries. I hope I will learn it quickly.

<br/>
Sorry for the formatting in this post; I need to learn how to write in Markdown. I hope it will be better in the next posts.</ol>
