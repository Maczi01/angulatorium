# Let's Start

Hello, I am Mattie.

I need to learn Angular, and this is the reason why I am starting this blog. I want to document my learning journey. I found a job where the company uses Angular. Although I have almost 3 years of experience with React, I need to learn Angular. I hope this blog will help me. My knowledge about Angular is currently limited. Here is what I know about Angular so far:

* It is a framework created by Google.
* TypeScript is the main language used.
* RxJS is used for reactive programming; I know it is complicated.
* Angular CLI is useful.
* `@Input` is similar to props in React.
* Classes and dependency injection are important.
* The community support is relatively poor.

I've written some Angular code, but mainly from tutorials.

```bash
Fun fact: I am using Analog to create this blog ;-)
```

How I Plan to Learn Angular

1. I will read the documentation.
2. I will watch tutorials.
3. Projects, projects, projects.
4. I will use the SoloLearn app (there is one for Angular).
5. I will write blog posts.
6. I will watch conferences.
7. I think this is enough for the first post. Sorry for the formatting in this post; I need to learn how to write in Markdown. I hope it will be better in the next posts.
